    <br>
    Cyber Safety is implemented in various organizations to protect data. This protection is known as information
    Primarily, information security is deployed in areas where digital data is stored and is highly
    vulnerable to attacks. This includes information systems, apps, and websites.

            <h3>Understanding Artificial Intelligence (AI)
                When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots.
                That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on
                Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.

                Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a
                machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex.
                The
                goals of artificial intelligence include mimicking human cognitive activity. Researchers and developers
                in
                the field are making surprisingly rapid strides in mimicking activities such as learning, reasoning, and

                remain skeptical because all cognitive activity is laced with value judgments that are subject to human
                experience.</h3>
